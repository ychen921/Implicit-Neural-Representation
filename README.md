# Implicit-Neural-Representation
In this project, we have hands-on experience with implicit neural representation (INR). With INR, we parameterize some signal (in our case images) with a neural network (feed-forward network). While in practice this might be useful for outpainting, super-resolution, and compression, in this project we will mainly focus on the basics, with some proof-of-concept outpainting at the end.
